aes-kdf, to store the master password the string should be hashed
 and then a component of the hash should be used to derive the key,
 the hash value of this key should be stored in the text file for the
 login procedure, so that dictionary and guessing attacks can be made
 totally unpredictable

 when you click on an entry the entry data is decrypted right there and
 then once the password viewing is over the variables that hold the value
 should be hashed and then unassigned.

 if the user chooses to create a key-file for authentication, then encrypt
 the generated key with the master password

make a txt file for tracking every where sensitive data travels
